    The bundle's own translation unit.

    There is no entry point to write. `plugMain` lives in the SDK, the host
    resolves it by name after dlopen, and everything past that follows from the
    `CFFGLPluginInfo` that Photofinish.cpp registers at static-initialisation
    time. This file exists so the bundle target has a source of its own, and it
    carries the one thing worth being able to read back out of a shipped
    binary: which build it is.
